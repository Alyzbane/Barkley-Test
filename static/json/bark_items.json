      "description": "This wood has a seeming split personality. One the one hand there is the humble Narra, with good workability and dimensional stability (much like other members of the Pterocarpus genus)â€”on the other hand there is the exotic and highly-prized burl wood known as Amboyna. Both come from the same tree (Pterocarpus indicus), though the resemblance between the two is virtually unrecognizable."
